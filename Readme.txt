Overview

This project is designed for the analysis and classification of URLs, particularly focusing on phishing detection. The implementation covers various aspects, including feature extraction, machine learning models, and deep learning models. Below is an overview of the main components and functionalities:
Components
URL Feature Extraction

    URL Features: Extracts relevant features from URLs for phishing detection.
    TLD Extraction: Utilizes the tld library to extract top-level domains from URLs.
    DNS Resolution: Resolves the IP address of the domain using the socket library.
    HTML Content Analysis: Employs PyQuery to analyze the HTML content of web pages.

Data Processing and Visualization

    Data Preprocessing: Utilizes pandas and numpy for data manipulation and preprocessing.
    Data Visualization: Uses seaborn and matplotlib for visualizing data distributions.

Machine Learning Models

    Classification Models: Employs scikit-learn to implement various machine learning classifiers.
    Model Evaluation: Evaluates models using confusion matrices, classification reports, ROC curves, etc.

Deep Learning Models

    TensorFlow Integration: Integrates TensorFlow for deep learning model implementation.
    Text Processing: Tokenizes and processes text data for deep learning models.
    Model Evaluation: Utilizes various metrics for evaluating deep learning model performance.

Dependencies

    scikitplot: A library for visualizing scikit-learn metrics.
    colorama: Adds color to terminal text for improved readability.
    tld: Extracts the top-level domain from URLs.
    pyquery: A Python library for processing HTML and XML.

Setup
