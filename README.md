# Malicious-URL-Detection
The project focuses on utilizing machine learning algorithms for the detection and prevention of malicious URLs, aiming to enhance online security and protect user data. The work includes the development and evaluation of various machine learning models, such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Adaboost, KNN, SGD, ExtraTree, SVC, Gaussian NB, 1D-CNN for their effectiveness in identifying malicious URLs.

The models were evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. Additionally, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Confusion Matrices were employed to assess the performance of KNN and Decision Trees.

The results indicate that the developed models achieved high precision, recall, and accuracy scores, demonstrating their potential for accurately identifying and preventing malicious URLs. Furthermore, the use of feature selection methods, such as selecting all features and selecting features by correlation with the target, influenced the performance of the models.

Overall, the project's findings suggest that machine learning algorithms, when appropriately trained and evaluated, hold promise for effectively detecting and mitigating cyber threats associated with malicious URLs, thereby contributing to improved online security and user data protection.
## Findings:
The Malicious URL Detection project can be successfully developed and implemented as an effective
system for identifying and blocking malicious URLs. By leveraging a combination of traditional machine
learning models and deep learning techniques, robust results can be achieved in classifying URLs as
benign or malicious. This solution has a significant impact, enhancing online security, protecting users
from cyber threats, and contributing to a safer online environment. The insights/inferences from this
project can be summarized as below:

•  Feature extraction, including various characteristics of URLs such as length, entropy, and
counts of specific characters, contributes to building a robust model for detecting malicious
URLs. Domain-related information and URL structure are crucial in capturing patterns
indicative of phishing, malware, and defacement attacks. The choice of features aligns with
the understanding that the landscape of malicious URLs is continually evolving. By
leveraging features related to URL structure and content, the model can adapt to new
techniques employed by cybercriminals.

•  The project emphasizes the importance of feature selection for model performance.
Features like URL length, domain, subdomain, and various counts (characters, special
characters) play a crucial role in distinguishing between benign and malicious URLs. The
Random Forest feature importance technique highlights specific features that contribute
significantly to the reduction in impurity across decision trees. This emphasizes the need
for focusing on relevant features to improve model interpretability and avoid overfitting.

•  The exceptional performance of the 1D CNN classifier suggests that deep learning,
especially at the character level, is effective in capturing intricate patterns within URLs. This
insight implies that the hierarchical representations learned by a CNN can discern complex
relationships between characters.

•  We can observe a collective challenge in correctly classifying phishing attacks (label 2). This
insight indicates a potential area for improvement in the model's ability to identify and
differentiate phishing URLs effectively.

In summary, the impact of features extracted from the data underscore the importance of thoughtful
feature selection and the effectiveness of deep learning in addressing the challenges of malicious URL
detection. The insights provide guidance for refining the model, improving its capability to handle
evolving threats, and enhancing its practical application in real-world scenarios
